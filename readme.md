# Midas Framework

**A nimble little SASS powered kickstarter for modern RWD web builds.**

Current frameworks don't <a href="http://jamessteel.co.uk/blog/roll-your-own-framework-overview">teach people anything</a> much about web development, so over the last few months I have published an <a href="http://jamessteel.co.uk/blog/roll-your-own-framework-series">eight part guide</a> to assembling your own SASS framework that works the way you do.

This kickstarter is the result of that series.

It's time we started to think.

## Simple Usage

You can just grab the files and work with CodeKit, Prepos or similar. Alternatively a simple Gulp config is provided: 

## Gulp Usage

1. Install NPM
2. Run from terminal in your midas folder:

`npm install gulp browser-sync streamqueue gulp-minify-css gulp-concat gulp-uglify gulp-rename gulp-sass --save-dev`

then start some magic with:

`gulp`
